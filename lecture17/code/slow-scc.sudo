Mark all vertices in V as not visited
for each vertex u in V not visited yet do
    find SCC(G, u)the strong component of u:
        Compute rch(G, u) using DFS(G, u)
        Compute rch(G_rev, u) using DFS(G_rev, u)
        SCC(G, u) = intersection of rch(G, u) and rch(G_rev, u)
        for every v in SCC(G, u): Mark v as visited
