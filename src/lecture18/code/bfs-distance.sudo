BFS(s):
    Mark all vertices as unvisited
    for each v set dist(v) = infinity
    Initialize search tree T to be empty
    Mark vertex s as visited and set dist(s) = 0
    set Q to be the empty queue
    enq(s)
    while Q is not empty do
        u = deq(Q)
        for each vertex v in Adj(u) do
            if v is not visited then
                add edge (u, v) to T
                Mark v as visited and enq(v)
                set dist(v) = dist(u) + 1
