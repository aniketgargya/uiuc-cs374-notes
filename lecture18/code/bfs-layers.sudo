BFS(s):
    Mark all vertices as unvisited
    Initialize search tree T to be empty
    Mark vertex s as visited and set L_0 = { s }
    i = 0
    while L_i is not empty do
        initialize L_(i+1) to be an empty list
        for each u in L_i do
            for each edge (u, v) in Adj(u) do
                if v is not visited then
                    add edge (u, v) to T
                    Mark v as visited
                    add v to L_(i+1)
        i++
