# UIUC CS 374: Introduction to Algorithms and Models of Computation

## Intro
These are my notes for CS 374: Introduction to Algorithms and Models of Computation. I took the class Spring 2020, and here's the course website for the semester: https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2021/.

## The Course
The course is divided into three sections:

1. Models of Computation
    - What is a Regular Language
    - What is a Regular Expression, Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), and Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA)
    - What can and cannot be computed via DFAs and NFAs
    - What is a Turing Machine
    - What is a Universal Turing Machine
2. Algorithms
    - Reductions
    - Divide and Conquer
    - Backtracking
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Graphs
    - Breadth and Depth First Search
    - Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Topological Sort, and Strongly Connected Components
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Bellman-Ford
    - Floyd-Warshall
3. Limits of Computing
    - Reductions
    - Decideable and Undecideable Languages
    - Halting Problem
    - 3SAT
    - P and NP
    - NP Completeness
